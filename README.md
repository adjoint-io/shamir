# Shamir

Shamir secret sharing is a cryptographic technique to split an arbitrary secret S
into N parts, of which at least K are required to reconstruct S.

Splitting a secret works by encoding the secret as the constant in a random
polynomial of K degree.

Using a fixed set of points we can reconstruct the secret using Lagrange
interpolation.

## Usage

A simple example of sharing and reconstructing a secret:

```haskell
import Protolude
import Data.Field.Galois (Prime)
import Shamir (shareSecret, reconstructSecret)

type Fq = Prime 21888242871839275222246405745257275088696311157297823662689037894645226208583

secret :: Fq
secret = 123456789

k :: Int
k = 3

n :: Int
n = 6

main :: IO ()
main = do
  putText $ "Parties: " <> show n
  putText $ "Threshold: " <> show k
  shares <- shareSecret secret k n
  putText $ "Secret reconstructed from minimum subset of shares: "
    <> (show $ secret == reconstructSecret (take k shares))
  putText $ "Secret reconstructed from less than minimum subset of shares: "
    <> (show $ secret == reconstructSecret (take (k - 1) shares))
```
